✅ Layer 7: Application Layer
This is the layer where users and applications interact.
When I open the Netflix app or website, the request starts from this layer.
Netflix uses HTTP/HTTPS APIs to fetch data like movie list, thumbnails, user profile, and playback details.
All user actions like selecting a movie, searching a title, or logging in happen here.
✅ Netflix Example:
 I tap “Play” on Netflix. The HTTPS request goes from the application layer to the server.

✅ Layer 6: Presentation Layer
This layer handles data formatting, encryption, compression, and encoding.
It ensures data is in a readable form for both sender and receiver.
Netflix uses SSL/TLS encryption so that all communication stays secure.
✅ Netflix Example:
 The video data is encrypted with TLS and compressed before it is sent to me.

✅ Layer 5: Session Layer
This layer manages the session between my device and Netflix servers.
It creates, maintains, and closes connections.
It supports session tokens, cookies, and user state.
✅ Netflix Example:
 When I start streaming a movie, the session is created and remains active as long as I am watching.
 If the connection drops, the session layer helps resume from the same point.

✅ Layer 4: Transport Layer
This layer ensures reliable or unreliable data delivery.
Uses TCP or UDP.
Manages port numbers, flow control, error control, and segmentation.
✅ Netflix Example:
The Netflix video streaming mainly uses TCP port 443 (HTTPS).
TCP ensures all video chunks reach correctly and in order.
If any chunk is lost, TCP resends it.

✅ Layer 3: Network Layer
This layer handles routing, IP addresses, and packet forwarding.
It finds the best path for data to travel from my house to Netflix servers.
Uses routers and IP packets.
✅ Netflix Example:
 My request goes through my ISP, then through multiple internet routers, and finally reaches Netflix’s CDN server using IP routing.

✅ Layer 2: Data Link Layer
This layer works inside the local network.
It uses MAC addresses, frames, ARP, and handles error detection.
It ensures device-to-device delivery on the same network.
✅ Netflix Example:
 My device sends frames to my Wi-Fi router using MAC addresses.
 The router takes those frames and forwards them toward the next hop.

✅ Layer 1: Physical Layer
This is the actual hardware layer.
Deals with signals, cables, radio waves, Wi-Fi frequencies.
Converts data into electrical or radio signals.
✅ Netflix Example:
 The video data moves through Wi-Fi signals, fibre cables, or 4G/5G signals until it reaches my device.

✅ Final Summary (One line per layer)
You can say this at the end of your interview answer:
Layer 7 – Application: Netflix app sends HTTPS request.
Layer 6 – Presentation: Data encrypted and compressed.
Layer 5 – Session: Streaming session maintained.
Layer 4 – Transport: TCP ensures reliable delivery on port 443.
Layer 3 – Network: IP routing to Netflix CDN.
Layer 2 – Data Link: Frames move between device and router using MAC.
Layer 1 – Physical: Signals travel through Wi-Fi or cables.
